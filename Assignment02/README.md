# Introduction
Lexical semantics and vector semantics are fundamental in NLP. Lexical semantics analyzes word meanings through linguistic principles, while vector semantics represents words as high-dimensional vectors based on contextual patterns. These paradigms offer distinct approaches to understanding word meanings.

The project focuses on evaluating vector semantics methods through empirical analysis, providing insights into their effectiveness and efficiency in NLP tasks. The document adheres to the ACM formatting guidelines and includes figures, citations, and references for clarity and academic rigor.

As a quick starter pack, a [notebook]([https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NyCn4j8OtPQsmAMty41PN6Na9l6T9q4t](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JvCMAtlB4PUl-9dM4RexCVruyTwyYm3m#scrollTo=4kXGnvbvxn_I)) is considered with the running example and parameters.
The provided link contains code that selects 500 random samples from two corpora and runs the project for two window sizes and two vector sizes. It's important to note that due to the randomness of the sample selection and the limited configurations, the results obtained from running the code may differ from the original ones provided in the report. This implementation serves as a demonstration or running sample of the code rather than a replication of the exact experiment described in the report.
